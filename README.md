# Course Horse

A platform designed to connect Learners and Educators, giving access to knowledge worldwide. From Elementary-level Biology to Collegiate-level Chemistry, Course Horse promotes varying levels of courses in all topics.

Course Horse is a Next.js Typescript based webapp, deployed using Vercel and MongoDB Atlas.

## Getting Started

Being a Next.js project, Course Horse is very easy to get running on a system.

### Node and NPM

To run Course Horse, you will need to have an installation of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### MongoDB

You will need access to a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. This can be done by either having an instance locally installed on your machine to connect to, or having one available via the web (such as by using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)).

Once done, you will need to configure the .env (or .env.local) file and ensure that the correct connection info and credentials are entered.

### Running Course Horse

After all system dependencies are installed, you will need to install the project dependencies using npm.

```
npm i
